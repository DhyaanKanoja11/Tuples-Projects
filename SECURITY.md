# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Our Tuples Project is committed to providing security updates for specific versions. Please find below the list of supported versions along with their corresponding support status:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.9.x   | :x:                |
| 0.8.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.8   | :x:                |

- **1.0.x**: This is the latest stable release, and it is actively supported with security updates. We encourage users to update to this version for the most secure experience.

- **0.9.x**: Versions in this range are no longer actively supported for security updates. We recommend upgrading to the latest version (1.0.x) if you are using any of these versions.

- **0.8.x**: We continue to provide security updates for versions in this range. However, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest stable release (1.0.x) for the best security.

- Versions below 0.8 are no longer supported, and we recommend immediate upgrade to a supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Tuples Project, please report it to us promptly. Your efforts to disclose potential issues are greatly appreciated. To report a vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Send an email to our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:dhyaandk11@gmail.com).

2. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to assess and address the issue.

3. Our security team will acknowledge your report within 5 business days and work on assessing the reported vulnerability.

4. We will keep you informed about the progress and expected timelines for addressing the vulnerability.

5. Once the vulnerability is validated, we will work on a fix and release a security update.

6. We will publicly acknowledge your contribution if you agree to be credited once the vulnerability is resolved.

7. In case the vulnerability is not accepted, we will provide a clear rationale for the decision.

Please note that it's important to act responsibly and refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it.

Thank you for your help in keeping our Tuples Project secure and making it a safer environment for all users.
