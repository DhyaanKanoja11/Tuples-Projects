Now, let's explore the powerful concepts of tuple packing and unpacking, which can make your code more efficient and elegant.
###
**Tuple Packing:**
Packing is the process of combining multiple values into a single tuple. It's a fundamental concept in Python, and it happens automatically when you create a tuple.
##
For example, consider the following code:

```python
person = "Alice", 28, "New York"
```

In this line, we're packing three values into a single tuple named `person`. Python recognizes the comma-separated values and creates a tuple. This is a concise way to group related data together.

**Tuple Unpacking:**
Unpacking is the reverse process of extracting values from a tuple and assigning them to individual variables. You can unpack a tuple using multiple assignment:

```python
name, age, city = person
```
##
Now, the values "Alice," 28, and "New York" are assigned to the variables `name`, `age`, and `city`, respectively. Tuple unpacking is a convenient way to work with multiple values simultaneously.

Tuple packing and unpacking are frequently used in functions to return multiple values or in loops to iterate over multiple elements. Understanding these concepts is crucial for making your Python code more readable and expressive.
