## **Exercises:**
###
1. **Tuple Creation and Access:**
   - Create a tuple representing a point in 3D space (x, y, z) and write code to access each coordinate individually.
###
2. **Tuple Comprehensions:**
   - Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing the squares of the even numbers using tuple comprehensions.
###
3. **Handling Tuple Errors:**
   - Create a program that demonstrates error handling with tuples. Try to access elements that are out of range and handle the resulting IndexError gracefully.
###
4. **Tuple Iteration:**
   - Write a program that takes two tuples, one containing names and the other containing corresponding scores. Use tuple iteration to print out each name and score.
###
## **Projects:**

1. **Data Analysis with Tuples:**
   - Choose a dataset or gather some data related to a topic of interest. Use tuples to represent data points and perform various analyses. For example, you could create a tuple for each data entry and calculate statistics like the mean, median, or mode.
###
2. **Inventory Management:**
   - Create a program to manage inventory using tuples. Each tuple could represent an item with attributes like name, price, and quantity. Implement features to add, remove, and update items in the inventory.
###
3. **Student Database:**
   - Build a student database system using dictionaries with tuples as values. Each student's information, such as name, age, and grades, can be represented as a tuple. Allow users to add, edit, and retrieve student records.
###
4. **Simple Memoization:**
   - Implement a memoization system using tuples. Create a function that takes multiple arguments and caches the results using tuples. This can be used to optimize recursive functions or computations.
###
5. **Geographical Data:**
   - Create a program to work with geographical data, such as cities and their coordinates. Use tuples to represent each city's data, and implement features to find the nearest city to a given location or calculate distances.
